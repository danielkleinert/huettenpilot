# H√ºttenplan üèîÔ∏è

Ever tried booking a multi-day Alpine hut tour during peak season? It's like playing Tetris with mountain reservations - you need consecutive nights across multiple huts, but availability is scattered and constantly changing. H√ºttenplan solves this by intelligently finding date ranges where all your selected huts have beds available.

## Background

Born from the pure frustration of manually checking dozens of hut websites for that perfect week in July, this project became an experiment in AI-driven development. How far could Claude Code take us? Turns out, pretty far - from concept to a fully functional app with 400+ huts, real-time availability, and multi-language support.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Fair warning**: I haven't looked at every line of generated slop, so this could fall apart any second now. Use at your own risk for actual hut bookings!
